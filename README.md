### About Me ###
Hello everyone, I am a 25 year old guy who just wants to learn to code. My favorite color is green, specifically emerald green. I do photography as a hobby mostly doing landscape and macro shots of plants and mushrooms. I have two favorites animals and I classify them as domesticated and wild. My favorite domestic animal is the cat while my favorite wild animal is the Red Panda.

I first started learning on JavaScript as a kid. My dad had a job in coding and I got curious of what he was doing when he'd work at home. He started to teach me JavaScript assigning me to make a simple game. I had intended to make something like Space Invaders with a sprite the player controlled side to side that shot at descending sprites. I never did finish when custody of me and my brother went to our mother.

Later on around 2010 on ROBLOX with Lua and spent a few years with it. I had some projects I personally worked on, but I never felt I was applying it and I didn't feel good enough to source myself to others for their projects.

I had always kept a basic knowledge of coding and have made some small programs that are essentially just joke programs. I wasn't into coding seriously. Then I went to college; my experience didn't go well. I was not prepared and afer changing majors several times I eventually ended up from Pre-Med to Cybersecurity. Cybersec was a blast, but COVID hit and doing some of my other classes virtually just was not the same for me. My grades in other classes started to fall, so I decided after that semester I was done with college.

Since then though, I haven't been able to pull my mind away from Cybersecurity nor coding in general. So now here I am taking my first steps back into this world.

### My Goals ###
I am not really sure what my goals are myself. I kinda just want to get experience, get a portfolio, and maybe try to find a career in this field. Maybe I'll just code for fun. I'm not very creative and artistic so the visual end of things I am not interested in.
